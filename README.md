# Introduction
Gives notes on starting to program using scratch

## Installing and what is this?
* Go to [Resources](#resources) download and install Scratch
* Discussion on Scratch Program (What is What)
  + Stage
  + Scripting Area
  + Sprites and Scripts
  + Coding Blocks
  + Paint Editor (Basics)
* Make a Sprite Move, first program

## Scratch Cards
Firstly go through the [scratch cards](#scratch_cards), these give the small techniques that are commonly used in Scratch programs such as games or stories, the techniques include
 * change colour
 * move
    + move to a beat
    + key moves
    + glide
    + follow the mouse
    + dance
 * say something
 * interactive whirl (effects)
 * animatation
 * surprize button
 * keep score

## First Game
Select from a selection, will have a vote and on
The Selection is :
* [Maze Game](https://inventwithscratch.com/book/chapter3.html)
* [Virtual Pet]()
* A Paddle based game ( honour Ping-Pong, hello world for games)
* Others and suggestions

TO DO, will do this once or twice depending on how we get on
* Create Title Page
* Create Instructions Page ( so players know how to play the game, this is good game palnning to do this first)
* Game must have a score ( how well the player is doing)
* Game must have an End Page ( i.e. you have won or you have lost)

## Keep a Library
Reusing code is the easiest way to create fast
* exporting and importing sprites
* Title Page
* Instruction Page
* Question: From the first game is there anything that could be used in other games
* TBD

## Versioning and Github
 ( Optional) for  Ninga's ahead of the curve, going on-line creating an account, be nice and let parents know (Cyber Security reasons)
* Place the Library on your Github account
* Share your library with another Ninga
## Project
Ninja comes up with own idea and develop and make presentation
* Each Ninja to make a presentation in with a chance to get a XXXX badge
* NOTE: More information during the year, i.e why is it right to award badges?
